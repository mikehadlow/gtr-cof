# Guitar Dashboard

An interactive music theory dashboard for guitarists. http://guitardashboard.com/

The aim is to provide a graphical representation of music theory elements (scales, modes, chords etc) mapped to a guitar fretboard.

## Getting started with the codebase

Guitar dashboard is a static website with a single HTML page and a client-side TypeScript application that implements a music theory algorithm that renders SVG.

Guitar dashboard uses [Bun](https://bun.com/).
